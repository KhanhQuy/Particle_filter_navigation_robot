A common problem with previous UAV tracking systems is reliance on the measurement data from only a single sensor. The effectiveness and stability of the UAV system can collapse in case of malfunction or damage from a sensor occur. Moreover, almost all tracking sensors mounted on UAVs come with errors and noise because of their hardware limits. Further, they also have the significant disadvantage of only working in specific environments and conditions. Especially, the high-accuracy pose estimation is highly challenging when the UAV flies in cluttered environments with disturbances, for example, wind gusts.
